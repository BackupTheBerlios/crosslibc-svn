This is a runtime loader for a.out and static ELF binary files. It is not bug
free (amongst other things, ELF binaries segfault after finishing ...), but it
works.


You may notice that rtload uses the stack extensively, and this may seem unsafe
to you. This is obviously unsafe, but there are two mitigating factors:

1) The stack is the /only/ area in memory which will reliably remain
   un-clobbered after loading a binary.
2) The problem of stack-overflow is moot: A stack overflow would allow a
   maliciously written binary run arbitrary code, but the purpose of this
   program is to let a binary run arbitrary code. Taking advantage of a stack
   overflow wouldn't actually be helpful in this regard.
