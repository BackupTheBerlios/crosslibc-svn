This is a runtime loader for a.out binary files. It is a proof-of-concept for a
future runtime ELF loader, which will allow crosslibc binaries to run on non-
ELF platforms.

Right now, however, it only runs a.out binaries.


You may notice that rtload uses the stack extensively, and this may seem unsafe
to you. This is obviously unsafe, but there are two mitigating factors:

1) The stack is the /only/ area in memory which will reliably remain
   un-clobbered after loading a binary.
2) The problem of stack-overflow is moot: A stack overflow would allow a
   maliciously written binary run arbitrary code, but the purpose of this
   program is to let a binary run arbitrary code. Taking advantage of a stack
   overflow wouldn't actually be helpful in this regard.
