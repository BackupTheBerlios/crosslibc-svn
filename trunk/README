HOW TO USE CROSSLIBC:

(This tutorial uses /opt/crossc/i586-elf as the prefix, you can change it as
you please)


First you need binutils and gcc compiled for i586-elf, like so:

binutils:
./configure --prefix=/opt/crossc/i586-elf --target=i586-elf --disable-multilib \
 --enable-targets=i586-elf,i586-mingw32
make all install

gcc:
./configure --prefix=/opt/crossc/i586-elf --target=i586-elf \
 --without-headers --with-newlib --disable-threads \
 --disable-shared --enable-static --enable-languages=c \
 --disable-libssp
make all install


After binutils and gcc are installed, add them to your path:
export PATH="/opt/crossc/i586-elf/bin:$PATH"


Now extract newlib and put it in a directory named "newlib", next to the
directory "crosslibc":
tar zxf newlib-1.13.0.tar.gz
mv newlib-1.13.0 newlib


Don't compile anything in the newlib directory, crosslibc will handle it for
you. cd into crosslibc and build it:
cd crosslibc
make install PREFIX=/opt/crossc/i586-elf


Now you can use i586-elf-gcc to make cross-compatible binaries! After making a
binary, use clcfixelf to fix it:

clcfixelf a.out

Then it should work on anything.
